# TODO
This is where I plan on dumping ideas. You may add pretty abstract and vague
ideas here if you wish, but I would prefer people to be somewhat specific.

  * Settings:
    I would like to create a little settings menu with features like changing the theme.
  * Custom CSS and JS files.
  * Markdown style syntax of bold and italic text (maybe big text too).
  * Picture support.
  * Status codes (We need these in main.go).
  * Possibly an electron app that works off of this server but is adapted to be tied to one journal.
  * Login system that uses a password (and is secure!).
  * Allow turning a planner page into a display page and not showing the ID of the planner.
  * Add password system, better logins
  * Add https
  


You may contribute or implement these ideas in a pull request if you would like.
